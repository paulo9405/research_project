# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the **Research Project** team! This document will guide you through the initial setup to start collaborating.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Git installed on your computer
- A GitHub account
- Been added as a collaborator to this repository

### Installing Git

**Windows:**
1. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install git
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

## Task 1: Clone the Repository

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project on your computer.

### Step 1: Create a folder for the project

Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and create a folder where you want to store the project:

```bash
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
```

### Step 2: Clone the repository

Run the following command to download the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulo9405/research_project.git
```

### Step 3: Enter the project folder

```bash
cd research_project
```

### Step 4: Verify the setup

Check that everything is working correctly:

```bash
git status
```

You should see a message like: `On branch main` and `nothing to commit, working tree clean`.

## What's Next?

Once you have cloned the repository:

1. Wait for the project leader to create your personal branch
2. You will receive instructions on how to switch to your branch
3. Never commit directly to the `main` branch

---

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during setup, contact the project leader.

---

**Important:** Only the project leader manages the `main` branch. Always work on your assigned branch.
