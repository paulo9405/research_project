## Week 1

**Date:** January 2025

### What we did

- Team meeting to define the project architecture and technologies
- Decided on a simple project with 3 screens related to surveys/research
- Created an empty repository on GitHub
- Each team member cloned the repository to their computer

### Technologies chosen

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Python | Backend language |
| Django | Web framework |
| Bootstrap | Frontend styling |
| SQLite | Database (native with Django) |

### Why these choices

- **Django**: Easy to learn and has many built-in features
- **Bootstrap**: Fast way to make the app look good
- **SQLite**: Comes with Django, no extra setup needed

### Next steps
